# Lip Reading with TensorFlow and YOLOv8
This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of performing lip reading using TensorFlow for the main network and YOLOv8 for lip detection and cropping from videos.

## Requirements
- TensorFlow (with GPU support for accelerated learning)
- YOLOv8
- CUDA-enabled GPU (for TensorFlow GPU acceleration)
- Python 3.x

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
  git clone https://github.com/patrick-3008/lip-reading.git
  cd lip-reading
2. Install dependencies:
   Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Then install required Python packages:
   Make sure to have TensorFlow installed with GPU support. You might need to install CUDA and cuDNN as per TensorFlow's GPU requirements.
3. Download YOLOv8 weights:
   Download the YOLOv8 weights from the official YOLO website or repository and place them in the yolo_weights/ directory.

## Team
This project was developed by Patrick Nashaat, Alfred Saad and Filopateer Fouad.
